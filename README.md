###Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

- PageObjectModel: contains page object classes that represent the web pages being tested.
- StepDefinitions: contains the step definition classes for SpecFlow scenarios.
- Features: contains the feature files that define the scenarios to test.

- Selenium - Web browser automation framework.
- SpecFlow - Behavior Driven Development (BDD) framework for .NET.
- .NET Core - Open-source, cross-platform framework for building modern applications.
- Visual Studio - Integrated development environment (IDE) for .NET development.


# Further Improvements for the project

- Use data-driven testing: Data-driven testing is a technique where we use different sets of data to test the same functionality. This can help us identify edge cases and make our tests more robust. We can use tools like Excel, CSV files, or databases to store our test data.

- Use parallel testing: Parallel testing is a technique where we run multiple tests simultaneously. This can help us save time and increase the speed of our test suite. We can use tools like NUnit or TestNG to run our tests in parallel.

- Use a continuous integration (CI) tool: A CI tool can help us automate our testing process and ensure that our tests are always up-to-date. We can use tools like Github Actions, Jenkins, Travis CI, or CircleCI to integrate our tests into our development workflow.

- Use logging and reporting: Logging and reporting can help us identify issues and debug our tests more easily. We can use tools like log4net or NLog to log our test results and tools like ExtentReports or ReportPortal to generate test reports.

- Use explicit waits: Explicit waits are a technique where we wait for a specific condition to occur before proceeding with the test. This can help us avoid race conditions and ensure that our tests are stable. We can use tools like WebDriverWait or FluentWait to implement explicit waits.

- Use headless testing: Headless testing is a technique where we run our tests without a graphical user interface. This can help us save time and resources and make our tests more scalable. We can use tools like PhantomJS or Headless Chrome to run our tests in a headless environment.
